<h1 id="id00013" style="margin-top: 5em">Book 01        Genesis</h1>

<p id="id00014">01:001:001 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</p>

<p id="id00015" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:001:002 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was
           upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon
           the face of the waters.</p>

<p id="id00016">01:001:003 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</p>

<p id="id00017">01:001:004 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;light from the darkness.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00018">01:001:005 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00019">01:001:006 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00020" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:001:007 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
           under the firmament from the waters which were above the
           firmament: and it was so.</p>

<p id="id00021" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:001:008 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
           morning were the second day.</p>

<p id="id00022" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:001:009 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered
           together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it
           was so.</p>

<p id="id00023" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:001:010 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together
           of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.</p>

<p id="id00024">01:001:011 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00025">01:001:012 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00026">01:001:013 And the evening and the morning were the third day.</p>

<p id="id00027" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:001:014 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the
           heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for
           signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:</p>

<p id="id00028" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:001:015 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to
           give light upon the earth: and it was so.</p>

<p id="id00029" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:001:016 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the
           day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars
           also.</p>

<p id="id00030">01:001:017 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon the earth,<br>
</p>

<p id="id00031">01:001:018 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00032">01:001:019 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.</p>

<p id="id00033" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:001:020 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
           creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth
           in the open firmament of heaven.</p>

<p id="id00034" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:001:021 And God created great whales, and every living creature that
           moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their
           kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that
           it was good.</p>

<p id="id00035" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:001:022 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
           fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the
           earth.</p>

<p id="id00036">01:001:023 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</p>

<p id="id00037">01:001:024 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth after his kind: and it was so.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00038">01:001:025 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00039" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:001:026 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
           likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
           and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over
           all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth
           upon the earth.</p>

<p id="id00040" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:001:027 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God
           created he him; male and female created he them.</p>

<p id="id00041">01:001:028 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00042">01:001:029 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be for meat.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00043">01:001:030 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00044">01:001:031 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00045">01:002:001 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of them.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00046">01:002:002 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had made.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00047">01:002:003 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that in it he had rested from all his work which God created<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and made.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00048">01:002:004 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the heavens,<br>
</p>

<p id="id00049" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:002:005 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and
           every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had
           not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man
           to till the ground.</p>

<p id="id00050" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:002:006 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
           face of the ground.</p>

<p id="id00051" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:002:007 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
           breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became
           a living soul.</p>

<p id="id00052" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:002:008 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there
           he put the man whom he had formed.</p>

<p id="id00053" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:002:009 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree
           that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of
           life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of
           knowledge of good and evil.</p>

<p id="id00054">01:002:010 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thence it was parted, and became into four heads.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00055">01:002:011 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;<br>
</p>

<p id="id00056">01:002:012 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;onyx stone.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00057">01:002:013 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00058" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:002:014 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which
           goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is
           Euphrates.</p>

<p id="id00059">01:002:015 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eden to dress it and to keep it.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00060">01:002:016 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the garden thou mayest freely eat:<br>
</p>

<p id="id00061" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:002:017 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
           not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou
           shalt surely die.</p>

<p id="id00062" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:002:018 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be
           alone; I will make him an help meet for him.</p>

<p id="id00063" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:002:019 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
           field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam
           to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called
           every living creature, that was the name thereof.</p>

<p id="id00064">01:002:020 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found an help meet for him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00065">01:002:021 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instead thereof;<br>
</p>

<p id="id00066" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:002:022 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a
           woman, and brought her unto the man.</p>

<p id="id00067" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:002:023 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
           flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of
           Man.</p>

<p id="id00068">01:002:024 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00069">01:002:025 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ashamed.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00070" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:003:001 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field
           which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea,
           hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</p>

<p id="id00071" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:003:002 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit
           of the trees of the garden:</p>

<p id="id00072" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:003:003 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the
           garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall
           ye touch it, lest ye die.</p>

<p id="id00073">01:003:004 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:</p>

<p id="id00074" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:003:005 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your
           eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good
           and evil.</p>

<p id="id00075" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:003:006 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
           that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to
           make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and
           gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.</p>

<p id="id00076" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:003:007 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
           were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made
           themselves aprons.</p>

<p id="id00077" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:003:008 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden
           in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves
           from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the
           garden.</p>

<p id="id00078">01:003:009 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;art thou?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00079">01:003:010 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00080" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:003:011 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou
           eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou
           shouldest not eat?</p>

<p id="id00081" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:003:012 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me,
           she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</p>

<p id="id00082" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:003:013 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou
           hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I
           did eat.</p>

<p id="id00083" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:003:014 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done
           this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast
           of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt
           thou eat all the days of thy life:</p>

<p id="id00084" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:003:015 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between
           thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou
           shalt bruise his heel.</p>

<p id="id00085" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:003:016 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
           thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and
           thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over
           thee.</p>

<p id="id00086" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:003:017 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the
           voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I
           commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is
           the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cakes upon the hearth.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00445" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:018:007 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and
           good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.</p>

<p id="id00446" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:018:008 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had
           dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under
           the tree, and they did eat.</p>

<p id="id00447" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:018:009 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,
           Behold, in the tent.</p>

<p id="id00448" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:018:010 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to
           the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.
           And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.</p>

<p id="id00449">01:018:011 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00450">01:018:012 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00451">01:018:013 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00452" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:018:014 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I
           will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and
           Sarah shall have a son.</p>

<p id="id00453">01:018:015 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00454">01:018:016 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00455">01:018:017 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do;<br>
</p>

<p id="id00456" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:018:018 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty
           nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in
           him?</p>

<p id="id00457" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:018:019 For I know him, that he will command his children and his
           household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD,
           to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon
           Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</p>

<p id="id00458" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:018:020 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
           great, and because their sin is very grievous;</p>

<p id="id00459" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:018:021 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether
           according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not,
           I will know.</p>

<p id="id00460">01:018:022 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00461">01:018:023 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteous with the wicked?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00462" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:018:024 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt
           thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty
           righteous that are therein?</p>

<p id="id00463" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:018:025 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the
           righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as
           the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all
           the earth do right?</p>

<p id="id00464">01:018:026 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00465">01:018:027 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:<br>
</p>

<p id="id00466">01:018:028 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00467">01:018:029 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forty's sake.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00468">01:018:030 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00469">01:018:031 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00471" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:018:033 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing
           with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</p>

<p id="id00472" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:019:001 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the
           gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and
           he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;</p>

<p id="id00473" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:019:002 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into
           your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet,
           and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they
           said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.</p>

<p id="id00474">01:019:003 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00475">01:019:004 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people from every quarter:<br>
</p>

<p id="id00476">01:019:005 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we may know them.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00477" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:019:006 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door
           after him,</p>

<p id="id00478">01:019:007 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.</p>

<p id="id00479">01:019:008 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00480">01:019:009 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00481" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:019:010 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the
           house to them, and shut to the door.</p>

<p id="id00482">01:019:011 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves to find the door.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00483">01:019:012 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the city, bring them out of this place:<br>
</p>

<p id="id00484">01:019:013 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sent us to destroy it.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00485" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:019:014 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which
           married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this
           place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as
           one that mocked unto his sons in law.</p>

<p id="id00486" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:019:015 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,
           saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are
           here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.</p>

<p id="id00487">01:019:016 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him forth, and set him without the city.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00488">01:019:017 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lest thou be consumed.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00489">01:019:018 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:</p>

<p id="id00490" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:019:019 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and
           thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me
           in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest
           some evil take me, and I die:</p>

<p id="id00491">01:019:020 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my soul shall live.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00492">01:019:021 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which thou hast spoken.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00493">01:019:022 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoar.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00494">01:019:023 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.</p>

<p id="id00495" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:019:024 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone
           and fire from the LORD out of heaven;</p>

<p id="id00496" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:019:025 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the
           inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the
           ground.</p>

<p id="id00497">01:019:026 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pillar of salt.<br>

<p id="id00498">01:019:027 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stood before the LORD:<br>
</p>

<p id="id00499" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:019:028 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the
           land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the
           country went up as the smoke of a furnace.</p>

<p id="id00500" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:019:029 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the
           plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the
           midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the
           which Lot dwelt.</p>

<p id="id00501">01:019:030 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00502">01:019:031 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the manner of all the earth:<br>
</p>

<p id="id00503" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:019:032 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with

<p id="id00504" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:019:033 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the
           firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived
           not when she lay down, nor when she arose.</p>

<p id="id00505" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:019:034 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said
           unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father:
           let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in,
           and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.</p>

<p id="id00506" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:019:035 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the

<p id="id00507">01:019:036 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their<br>

</p>

<p id="id00509" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:019:038 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name

<p id="id00510">01:020:001 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00511">01:020:002 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and<br>

</p>

<p id="id00512" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:020:003 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to

<p id="id00513" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:020:004 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt

<p id="id00514" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:020:005 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she
           herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart
           and innocency of my hands have I done this.</p>

<p id="id00515">01:020:006 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;touch her.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00516">01:020:007 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou,<br>

<p id="id00517" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:020:008 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all
           his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the
           men were sore afraid.</p>

<p id="id00518" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:020:009 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast
           thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou
           hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast
           done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.</p>

<p id="id00519">01:020:010 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou<br>

<p id="id00520">01:020:011 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is<br>

<p id="id00522" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:020:013 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my
           father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness
           which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall
           come, say of me, He is my brother.</p>

<p id="id00523" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:020:014 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
           womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him
           Sarah his wife.</p>

<p id="id00524" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:020:015 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell
           where it pleaseth thee.</p>

<p id="id00525" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:020:016 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a
           thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of
           the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other:
           thus she was reproved.</p>

<p id="id00526">01:020:017 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00527">01:020:018 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00528">01:021:001 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto Sarah as he had spoken.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00529">01:021:002 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the set time of which God had spoken to him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00530">01:021:003 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00531">01:021:004 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God had commanded him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00532">01:021:005 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;born unto him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00533">01:021:006 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear will laugh with me.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00534" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:021:007 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah
           should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in
           his old age.</p>

<p id="id00535">01:021:008 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00536">01:021:009 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;born unto Abraham, mocking.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00537" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:021:010 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and
           her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with
           my son, even with Isaac.</p>

<p id="id00538" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:021:011 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of
           his son.</p>

<p id="id00539" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:021:012 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight
           because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that
           Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in
           Isaac shall thy seed be called.</p>

<p id="id00540" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:021:013 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,
           because he is thy seed.</p>

<p id="id00541" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:021:014 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and
           a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her
           shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed,
           and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.</p>

<p id="id00542" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:021:015 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child
           under one of the shrubs.</p>

<p id="id00543">01:021:016 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her voice, and wept.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00544">01:021:017 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where he is.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00545" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:021:018 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will
           make him a great nation.</p>

<p id="id00546" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:021:019 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she
           went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad
           drink.</p>

<p id="id00547">01:021:020 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wilderness, and became an archer.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00548">01:021:021 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him a wife out of the land of Egypt.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00549" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:021:022 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol
           the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God
           is with thee in all that thou doest:</p>

<p id="id00550" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:021:023 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not
           deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son:
           but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou
           shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.</p>

<p id="id00551">01:021:024 And Abraham said, I will swear.</p>

<p id="id00552" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:021:025 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water,
           which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.</p>

<p id="id00553" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:021:026 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing;
           neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to
           day.</p>

<p id="id00554" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:021:027 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;
           and both of them made a covenant.</p>

<p id="id00555">01:021:028 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.</p>

<p id="id00556" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:021:029 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe
           lambs which thou hast set by themselves?</p>

<p id="id00557" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:021:030 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my
           hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged
           this well.</p>

<p id="id00558" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:021:031 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they
           sware both of them.</p>

<p id="id00559" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:021:032 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose
           up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they
           returned into the land of the Philistines.</p>

<p id="id00560" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:021:033 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on
           the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.</p>

<p id="id00561">01:021:034 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.</p>

<p id="id00562" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:022:001 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt
           Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here
           I am.</p>

<p id="id00563">01:022:002 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will tell thee of.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00564">01:022:003 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto the place of which God had told him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00565" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:022:004 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the
           place afar off.</p>

<p id="id00566">01:022:005 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again to you.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00567">01:022:006 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knife; and they went both of them together.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00568">01:022:007 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00569" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:022:008 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for
           a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.</p>

<p id="id00570" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:022:009 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and
           Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and
           bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.</p>

<p id="id00571">01:022:010 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slay his son.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00572">01:022:011 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00573" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:022:012 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou
           any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God,
           seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.</p>

<p id="id00574" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:022:013 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind
           him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went
           and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in
           the stead of his son.</p>

<p id="id00575" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:022:014 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it
           is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be
           seen.</p>

<p id="id00576" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:022:015 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven
           the second time,</p>

<p id="id00577" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:022:016 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because
           thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,
           thine only son:</p>

<p id="id00578" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:022:017 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will
           multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand
           which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the
           gate of his enemies;</p>

<p id="id00579">01:022:018 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because thou hast obeyed my voice.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00580">01:022:019 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00581" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:022:020 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told

<p id="id00585">01:022:024 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,<br>

</p>

<p id="id00586">01:023:001 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were the years of the life of Sarah.<br>

<p id="id00587" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:023:002 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land

           for her.</p>

<p id="id00588" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:023:003 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the
           sons of Heth, saying,</p>

<p id="id00589" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:023:004 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession

<p id="id00590">01:023:005 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,</p>

           thy dead.</p>

<p id="id00592" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:023:007 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the
           land, even to the children of Heth.</p>

<p id="id00593" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:023:008 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I
           should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for
           me to Ephron the son of Zohar,</p>

<p id="id00594">01:023:009 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my thigh:<br>
</p>

<p id="id00608">01:024:003 And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:<br>
</p>

<p id="id00609" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:024:004 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take

<p id="id00610" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:024:005 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not
           be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy
           son again unto the land from whence thou camest?</p>

<p id="id00611" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:024:006 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my

<p id="id00612" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:024:007 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house,
           and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and
           that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this
           land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take
           a wife unto my son from thence.</p>

<p id="id00613" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:024:008 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou
           shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son
           thither again.</p>

<p id="id00614" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:024:009 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his
           master, and sware to him concerning that matter.</p>

<p id="id00615" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:024:010 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master,
           and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his
           hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of
           Nahor.</p>

<p id="id00616">01:024:011 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;women go out to draw water.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00617">01:024:012 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00618" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:024:013 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters

           the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant
           Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness
           unto my master.</p>

<p id="id00620" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:024:015 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that,
           behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of
           Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher
           upon her shoulder.</p>

<p id="id00621" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:024:016 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither
           had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and
           filled her pitcher, and came up.</p>

<p id="id00622">01:024:017 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00623">01:024:018 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00624">01:024:019 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw<br>

</p>

<p id="id00625" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:024:020 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and
           ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his
           camels.</p>

<p id="id00626" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:024:021 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether
           the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.</p>

<p id="id00627" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:024:022 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the
           man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two
           bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;</p>

<p id="id00628">01:024:023 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is<br>

</p>

<p id="id00629">01:024:024 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of<br>

</p>

<p id="id00630">01:024:025 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender<br>

<p id="id00631">01:024:026 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.</p>

</p>

<p id="id00635" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:024:030 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets

           Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that
           he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at
           the well.</p>

<p id="id00643">01:024:038 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred,<br>

</p>

<p id="id00644">01:024:039 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not<br>

<p id="id00647" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:024:042 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my

<p id="id00651" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:024:046 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her

<p id="id00652" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:024:047 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she

<p id="id00653">01:024:048 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed<br>

           begat Isaac:</p>

<p id="id00692">01:025:020 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laban the Syrian.<br>

<p id="id00693">01:025:021 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wife conceived.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00694">01:025:022 And the children struggled together within her; and she said,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00695" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:025:023 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and
           two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and
           the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and
           the elder shall serve the younger.</p>

<p id="id00696">01:025:024 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there were twins in her womb.<br>

<p id="id00697">01:025:025 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they called his name Esau.<br>

<p id="id00698" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:025:026 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on
           Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was
           threescore years old when she bare them.</p>

<p id="id00699">01:025:027 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.<br>

<p id="id00700">01:025:028 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but<br>

</p>

<p id="id00702" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:025:030 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same

           Edom.</p>

<p id="id00703">01:025:031 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.</p>

<p id="id00704">01:025:032 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what<br>

</p>

<p id="id00705">01:025:033 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.<br>

<p id="id00706">01:025:034 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;despised his birthright.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00707">01:026:001 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king of the Philistines unto Gerar.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00708">01:026:002 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into<br>

           Abraham thy father;</p>

<p id="id00710" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:026:004 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven,

<p id="id00711" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:026:005 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my
           commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</p>

<p id="id00712">01:026:006 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:</p>

<p id="id00713" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:026:007 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said,

           said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah;
           because she was fair to look upon.</p>

<p id="id00714">01:026:008 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00715">01:026:009 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00716">01:026:010 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00717">01:026:011 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth<br>

</p>

<p id="id00718">01:026:012 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year<br>

</p>

<p id="id00719">01:026:013 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;became very great:<br>

<p id="id00720">01:026:014 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00721" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:026:015 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in
           the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped
           them, and filled them with earth.</p>

<p id="id00722">01:026:016 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much<br>

</p>

<p id="id00723">01:026:017 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Gerar, and dwelt there.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00724" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:026:018 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had
           digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines
           had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called
           their names after the names by which his father had called
           them.</p>

<p id="id00725" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:026:019 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a

<p id="id00726" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:026:020 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,
           saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well
           Esek; because they strove with him.</p>

<p id="id00727" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:026:021 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he
           called the name of it Sitnah.</p>

<p id="id00728" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:026:022 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for
           that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth;
           and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we
           shall be fruitful in the land.</p>

<p id="id00729">01:026:023 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.</p>

<p id="id00730" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:026:024 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am

           Abraham's sake.</p>

<p id="id00731" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:026:025 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the
           LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants
           digged a well.</p>

<p id="id00732">01:026:026 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his<br>

</p>

<p id="id00733">01:026:027 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye<br>

</p>

<p id="id00734">01:026:028 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;<br>
</p>

<p id="id00735">01:026:029 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00736">01:026:030 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said unto him, We have found water.<br>

<p id="id00743">01:027:002 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my<br>

<p id="id00937" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:031:050 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take
           other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God
           is witness betwixt me and thee.</p>

<p id="id00938" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:031:051 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this
           pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:</p>

<p id="id00939">01:031:052 This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00940">01:031:053 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father Isaac.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00941">01:031:054 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;night in the mount.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00942">01:031:055 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returned unto his place.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00943">01:032:001 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</p>

<p id="id00944">01:032:002 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called the name of that place Mahanaim.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00945">01:032:003 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the land of Seir, the country of Edom.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00946">01:032:004 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laban, and stayed there until now:<br>
</p>

<p id="id00947">01:032:005 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find grace in thy sight.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00948">01:032:006 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundred men with him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00949">01:032:007 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the camels, into two bands;<br>
</p>

<p id="id00950" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:032:008 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then
           the other company which is left shall escape.</p>

<p id="id00951" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:032:009 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my
           father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy
           country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:</p>

<p id="id00952" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:032:010 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all
           the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with
           my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two
           bands.</p>

<p id="id00953">01:032:011 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the mother with the children.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00954">01:032:012 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multitude.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00955">01:032:013 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;<br>
</p>

<p id="id00956">01:032:014 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and twenty rams,<br>
</p>

<p id="id00957">01:032:015 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00958">01:032:016 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00959">01:032:017 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00960">01:032:018 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00961">01:032:019 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto Esau, when ye find him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00962">01:032:020 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will accept of me.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00963" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:032:021 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that
           night in the company.</p>

<p id="id00964" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:032:022 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two
           womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford
           Jabbok.</p>

<p id="id00965">01:032:023 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he had.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00966">01:032:024 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until the breaking of the day.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00967" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:032:025 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched
           the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was
           out of joint, as he wrestled with him.</p>

<p id="id00968" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:032:026 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I
           will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</p>

<p id="id00969">01:032:027 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.</p>

<p id="id00970">01:032:028 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hast prevailed.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00971">01:032:029 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he blessed him there.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00972">01:032:030 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God face to face, and my life is preserved.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00973">01:032:031 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;halted upon his thigh.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00974">01:032:032 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that shrank.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00975">01:033:001 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;handmaids.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00976">01:033:002 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00977">01:033:003 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00978">01:033:004 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neck, and kissed him: and they wept.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00979" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:033:005 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;
           and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children
           which God hath graciously given thy servant.</p>

<p id="id00980" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:033:006 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and
           they bowed themselves.</p>

<p id="id00981" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:033:007 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed
           themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they
           bowed themselves.</p>

<p id="id00982">01:033:008 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00983">01:033:009 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto thyself.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00984" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:033:010 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in
           thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I
           have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and
           thou wast pleased with me.</p>

<p id="id00985" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:033:011 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee;
           because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have
           enough. And he urged him, and he took it.</p>

<p id="id00986" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:033:012 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I
           will go before thee.</p>

<p id="id00987" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:033:013 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are
           tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and
           if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.</p>

<p id="id00988" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:033:014 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I
           will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before
           me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my
           lord unto Seir.</p>

<p id="id00989" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:033:015 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk
           that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find
           grace in the sight of my lord.</p>

<p id="id00990">01:033:016 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.</p>

<p id="id00991">01:033:017 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called Succoth.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00992">01:033:018 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tent before the city.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00993">01:033:019 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for an hundred pieces of money.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00994">01:033:020 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.</p>

<p id="id00995" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:034:001 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob,
           went out to see the daughters of the land.</p>

<p id="id00996" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:034:002 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the
           country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled
           her.</p>

<p id="id00997">01:034:003 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00998">01:034:004 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;damsel to wife.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00999" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:034:005 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now
           his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his
           peace until they were come.</p>

<p id="id01000" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:034:006 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune
           with him.</p>

<p id="id01001" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:034:007 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard
           it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth,
           because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's
           daughter: which thing ought not to be done.</p>

<p id="id01002" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:034:008 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son
           Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to
           wife.</p>

<p id="id01003">01:034:009 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us, and take our daughters unto you.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01004">01:034:010 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01005" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:034:011 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me
           find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will
           give.</p>

<p id="id01006" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:034:012 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according
           as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.</p>

<p id="id01007">01:034:013 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sister:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01008">01:034:014 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto us:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01009" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:034:015 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,
           that every male of you be circumcised;</p>

<p id="id01010" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:034:016 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take
           your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will

<p id="id01011" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:034:017 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then
           will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.</p>

<p id="id01012">01:034:018 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.</p>

<p id="id01013" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:034:019 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had
           delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than
           all the house of his father.</p>

<p id="id01014" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:034:020 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their
           city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,</p>

<p id="id01015" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:034:021 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in
           the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large
           enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives,
           and let us give them our daughters.</p>

<p id="id01016">01:034:022 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are circumcised.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01017">01:034:023 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dwell with us.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01018">01:034:024 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that<br>

<p id="id01020">01:034:026 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the<br>

<p id="id01021">01:034:027 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,<br>

<p id="id01022">01:034:028 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and<br>

<p id="id01023" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:034:029 And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their

<p id="id01024" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:034:030 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make

<p id="id01025" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:034:031 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an

</p>

<p id="id01027">01:035:002 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clean, and change your garments:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01028">01:035:003 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and was with me in the way which I went.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01029">01:035:004 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01030">01:035:005 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities<br>

<p id="id01032">01:035:007 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called his name Israel.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01107">01:037:010 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?<br>
</p>

<p id="id01108" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:037:011 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the
           saying.</p>

<p id="id01109">01:037:012 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.</p>

<p id="id01110" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:037:013 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the
           flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he
           said to him, Here am I.</p>

<p id="id01111" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:037:014 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well
           with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word
           again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came
           to Shechem.</p>

<p id="id01112">01:037:015 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?<br>
</p>

<p id="id01113">01:037:016 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they feed their flocks.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01114" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:037:017 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them
           say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren,
           and found them in Dothan.</p>

<p id="id01115" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:037:018 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto
           them, they conspired against him to slay him.</p>

<p id="id01116">01:037:019 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.</p>

<p id="id01117" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:037:020 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into
           some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him:
           and we shall see what will become of his dreams.</p>

<p id="id01118" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:037:021 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;
           and said, Let us not kill him.</p>

<p id="id01119" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:037:022 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into
           this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him;
           that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to
           his father again.</p>

<p id="id01120" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:037:023 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,
           that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many
           colours that was on him;</p>

<p id="id01121" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:037:024 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was
           empty, there was no water in it.</p>

<p id="id01122" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:037:025 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes
           and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from
           Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh,
           going to carry it down to Egypt.</p>

<p id="id01123" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:037:026 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay
           our brother, and conceal his blood?</p>

<p id="id01124" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:037:027 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our
           hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his
           brethren were content.</p>

<p id="id01125" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:037:028 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and
           lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the
           Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought
           Joseph into Egypt.</p>

<p id="id01126">01:037:029 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the pit; and he rent his clothes.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01127">01:037:030 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I, whither shall I go?<br>
</p>

<p id="id01128">01:037:031 And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and dipped the coat in the blood;<br>
</p>

<p id="id01129" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:037:032 And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to
           their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether
           it be thy son's coat or no.</p>

<p id="id01130">01:037:033 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01131">01:037:034 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and mourned for his son many days.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01132" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:037:035 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;
           but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go
           down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept
           for him.</p>

<p id="id01133" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:037:036 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an
           officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.</p>

<p id="id01134" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:038:001 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from
           his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose
           name was Hirah.</p>

<p id="id01135" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:038:002 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose
           name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.</p>

<p id="id01136">01:038:003 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.</p>

<p id="id01137">01:038:004 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name Onan.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01138">01:038:005 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01139">01:038:006 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamar.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01140">01:038:007 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD; and the LORD slew him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01141">01:038:008 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01142" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:038:009 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to
           pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled
           it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his
           brother.</p>

<p id="id01143" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:038:010 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he
           slew him also.</p>

<p id="id01144">01:038:011 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01145">01:038:012 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adullamite.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01146" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:038:013 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth
           up to Timnath to shear his sheep.</p>

<p id="id01147" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:038:014 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her
           with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place,
           which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was
           grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.</p>

<p id="id01148" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:038:015 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because
           she had covered her face.</p>

<p id="id01149" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:038:016 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray
           thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was
           his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me,
           that thou mayest come in unto me?</p>

<p id="id01150" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:038:017 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she
           said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?</p>

<p id="id01151" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:038:018 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy
           signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine
           hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she
           conceived by him.</p>

<p id="id01152" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:038:019 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her,
           and put on the garments of her widowhood.</p>

<p id="id01153">01:038:020 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he found her not.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01154">01:038:021 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was no harlot in this place.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01155">01:038:022 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this place.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01156" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:038:023 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:
           behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.</p>

<p id="id01157">01:038:024 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01158">01:038:025 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bracelets, and staff.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01159" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:038:026 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more
           righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my
           son. And he knew her again no more.</p>

<p id="id01160" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:038:027 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,
           twins were in her womb.</p>

<p id="id01161" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:038:028 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out
           his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a
           scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.</p>

<p id="id01162" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:038:029 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold,
           his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken
           forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called
           Pharez.</p>

<p id="id01163" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:038:030 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet
           thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.</p>

<p id="id01164" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:039:001 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer
           of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of
           the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down
           thither.</p>

<p id="id01165">01:039:002 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01166">01:039:003 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01167" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:039:004 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he
           made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put
           into his hand.</p>

<p id="id01168" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:039:005 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him
           overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD
           blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the
           blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house,
           and in the field.</p>

<p id="id01169" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:039:006 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not
           ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was
           a goodly person, and well favoured.</p>

<p id="id01170" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:039:007 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife
           cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.</p>

<p id="id01171" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:039:008 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my
           master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath
           committed all that he hath to my hand;</p>

<p id="id01172" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:039:009 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he
           kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his
           wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against
           God?</p>

<p id="id01173" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:039:010 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that
           he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.</p>

<p id="id01174" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:039:011 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the
           house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the
           house there within.</p>

<p id="id01175">01:039:012 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01176">01:039:013 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in her hand, and was fled forth,<br>
</p>

<p id="id01177" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:039:014 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto
           them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to
           mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a
           loud voice:</p>

<p id="id01178" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:039:015 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice
           and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got
           him out.</p>

<p id="id01179">01:039:016 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.</p>

<p id="id01180" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:039:017 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The
           Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto
           me to mock me:</p>

<p id="id01181" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:039:018 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that
           he left his garment with me, and fled out.</p>

<p id="id01182">01:039:019 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01183">01:039:020 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the prison.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01184" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:039:021 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Egypt.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01188">01:040:002 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01189">01:040:003 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01190">01:040:004 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;served them: and they continued a season in ward.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01191" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:040:005 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in
           one night, each man according to the interpretation of his
           dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which
           were bound in the prison.</p>

<p id="id01192" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:040:006 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon
           them, and, behold, they were sad.</p>

<p id="id01193">01:040:007 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day?<br>
</p>

<p id="id01194">01:040:008 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01195" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:040:009 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to
           him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;</p>

<p id="id01196">01:040:010 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought forth ripe grapes:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01197">01:040:011 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharaoh's hand.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01198">01:040:012 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three branches are three days:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01199" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:040:013 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and
           restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's
           cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his
           butler.</p>

<p id="id01200">01:040:014 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01201">01:040:015 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dungeon.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01202">01:040:016 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three white baskets on my head:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01203">01:040:017 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;basket upon my head.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01204" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:040:018 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation
           thereof: The three baskets are three days:</p>

<p id="id01205" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:040:019 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off
           thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat
           thy flesh from off thee.</p>

<p id="id01206" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:040:020 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's
           birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he
           lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker
           among his servants.</p>

<p id="id01207">01:040:021 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01208">01:040:022 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01209">01:040:023 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.</p>

<p id="id01210">01:041:001 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01211">01:041:002 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01212" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:041:003 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the
           river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other
           kine upon the brink of the river.</p>

<p id="id01213">01:041:004 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01214">01:041:005 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01215">01:041:006 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sprung up after them.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01216">01:041:007 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01217" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:041:008 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was
           troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of
           Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his
           dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto
           Pharaoh.</p>

<p id="id01218">01:041:009 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remember my faults this day:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01219">01:041:010 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01220">01:041:011 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man according to the interpretation of his dream.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01221" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:041:012 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to
           the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted
           to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did
           interpret.</p>

<p id="id01222" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:041:013 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he
           restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.</p>

<p id="id01223">01:041:014 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01224">01:041:015 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01225">01:041:016 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01226">01:041:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon the bank of the river:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01227">01:041:018 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01228" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:041:019 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and
           very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all
           the land of Egypt for badness:</p>

<p id="id01229" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:041:020 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first
           seven fat kine:</p>

<p id="id01230" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:041:021 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that
           they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at
           the beginning. So I awoke.</p>

<p id="id01231">01:041:022 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stalk, full and good:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01232">01:041:023 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;east wind, sprung up after them:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01233" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:041:024 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told
           this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare
           it to me.</p>

<p id="id01234">01:041:025 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01235">01:041:026 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are seven years: the dream is one.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01236" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:041:027 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after
           them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with
           the east wind shall be seven years of famine.</p>

<p id="id01237">01:041:028 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01238">01:041:029 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the land of Egypt:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01239" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:041:030 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and
           all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and
           the famine shall consume the land;</p>

<p id="id01240" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:041:031 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of
           that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.</p>

<p id="id01241" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:041:032 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is
           because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly
           bring it to pass.</p>

<p id="id01242" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:041:033 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise,
           and set him over the land of Egypt.</p>

<p id="id01243">01:041:034 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seven plenteous years.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01244">01:041:035 And let them gather all the food of those good years that<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep food in the cities.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01245">01:041:036 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land perish not through the famine.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01246">01:041:037 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of all his servants.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01247">01:041:038 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?<br>
</p>

<p id="id01248">01:041:039 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01249" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:041:040 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall
           all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater
           than thou.</p>

<p id="id01250" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:041:041 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all
           the land of Egypt.</p>

<p id="id01251">01:041:042 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put a gold chain about his neck;<br>
</p>

<p id="id01252">01:041:043 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over all the land of Egypt.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01253">01:041:044 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egypt.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01254">01:041:045 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01255">01:041:046 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01256" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:041:047 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by
           handfuls.</p>

<p id="id01257" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:041:048 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were
           in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the
           food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he
           up in the same.</p>

<p id="id01258" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:041:049 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,
           until he left numbering; for it was without number.</p>

<p id="id01259">01:041:050 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bare unto him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01260">01:041:051 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01261">01:041:052 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01262">01:041:053 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egypt, were ended.<br>

<p id="id01263">01:041:054 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the land of Egypt there was bread.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01264">01:041:055 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01265">01:041:056 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.<br>

<p id="id01266">01:041:057 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;<br>

<p id="id01267">01:042:001 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said<br>

</p>

<p id="id01268" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:042:002 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt:

           live, and not die.</p>

<p id="id01269">01:042:003 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.</p>

<p id="id01271">01:042:005 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the famine was in the land of Canaan.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01272">01:042:006 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01273">01:042:007 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Canaan to buy food.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01274">01:042:008 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.</p>

<p id="id01275" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:042:009 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and
           said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land
           ye are come.</p>

<p id="id01276">01:042:010 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servants come.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01277">01:042:011 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no spies.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01278">01:042:012 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land ye are come.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01279" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:042:013 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of
           one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is
           this day with our father, and one is not.</p>

<p id="id01280">01:042:014 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Ye are spies:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01281">01:042:015 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01282" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:042:016 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall
           be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether
           there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh
           surely ye are spies.</p>

<p id="id01283">01:042:017 And he put them all together into ward three days.</p>

<p id="id01284" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:042:018 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live;
           for I fear God:</p>

<p id="id01285" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:042:019 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the
           house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your
           houses:</p>

<p id="id01286" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:042:020 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words
           be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.</p>

<p id="id01287" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:042:021 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning
           our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he
           besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress
           come upon us.</p>

<p id="id01288" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:042:022 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you,
           saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear?
           therefore, behold, also his blood is required.</p>

<p id="id01289" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:042:023 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake
           unto them by an interpreter.</p>

<p id="id01290">01:042:024 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to them again, and communed with them, and took from them<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01291">01:042:025 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01292">01:042:026 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.</p>

<p id="id01293" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:042:027 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender
           in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his
           sack's mouth.</p>

<p id="id01294" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:042:028 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo,
           it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they
           were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath
           done unto us?</p>

<p id="id01295">01:042:029 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and told him all that befell unto them; saying,<br>
</p>

<p id="id01296">01:042:030 The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;took us for spies of the country.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01297">01:042:031 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:</p>

<p id="id01298" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:042:032 We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the
           youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.</p>

<p id="id01299" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:042:033 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby
           shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren
           here with me, and take food for the famine of your households,
           and be gone:</p>

<p id="id01300" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:042:034 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know
           that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I
           deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.</p>

<p id="id01301" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:042:035 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,
           every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both
           they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were
           afraid.</p>

<p id="id01302">01:042:036 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01303">01:042:037 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bring him to thee again.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01304" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:042:038 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his
           brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him
           by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my
           gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</p>

<p id="id01305">01:043:001 And the famine was sore in the land.</p>

<p id="id01306">01:043:002 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again, buy us a little food.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01307">01:043:003 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be with you.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01308" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:043:004 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy
           thee food:</p>

<p id="id01309" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:043:005 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the
           man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your
           brother be with you.</p>

<p id="id01310" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:043:006 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell
           the man whether ye had yet a brother?</p>

<p id="id01311" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:043:007 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of
           our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another
           brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these
           words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your
           brother down?</p>

<p id="id01312">01:043:008 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we, and thou, and also our little ones.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01313">01:043:009 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let me bear the blame for ever:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01314" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:043:010 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this
           second time.</p>

<p id="id01315" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:043:011 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now,
           do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels,
           and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little
           honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:</p>

<p id="id01316" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:043:012 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was
           brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in
           your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:</p>

<p id="id01317">01:043:013 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:</p>

<p id="id01318">01:043:014 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of my children, I am bereaved.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01319">01:043:015 And the men took that present, and they took double money in<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and stood before Joseph.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01320">01:043:016 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for these men shall dine with me at noon.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01321" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:043:017 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men
           into Joseph's house.</p>

<p id="id01322" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:043:018 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into
           Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was
           returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in;
           that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and
           take us for bondmen, and our asses.</p>

<p id="id01323">01:043:019 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;communed with him at the door of the house,<br>
</p>

<p id="id01324">01:043:020 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;food:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01325" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:043:021 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened
           our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of
           his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it
           again in our hand.</p>

<p id="id01326" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:043:022 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:
           we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.</p>

<p id="id01327">01:043:023 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01328">01:043:024 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provender.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01329" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:043:025 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon:
           for they heard that they should eat bread there.</p>

<p id="id01330" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:043:026 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which
           was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him
           to the earth.</p>

<p id="id01331" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:043:027 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father
           well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?</p>

<p id="id01332" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:043:028 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health,
           he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made
           obeisance.</p>

<p id="id01333" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:043:029 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his
           mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom
           ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my
           son.</p>

<p id="id01334" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:043:030 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his
           brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his
           chamber, and wept there.</p>

<p id="id01335" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:043:031 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself,
           and said, Set on bread.</p>

<p id="id01336" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:043:032 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by
           themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by
           themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the
           Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</p>

<p id="id01337">01:043:033 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men marvelled one at another.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01338">01:043:034 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they drank, and were merry with him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01339">01:044:001 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every man's money in his sack's mouth.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01340">01:044:002 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that Joseph had spoken.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01341" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:044:003 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they
           and their asses.</p>

<p id="id01342" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:044:004 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,
           Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and
           when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye
           rewarded evil for good?</p>

<p id="id01343" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:044:005 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed
           he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.</p>

<p id="id01344">01:044:006 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.</p>

<p id="id01345">01:044:007 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God forbid that thy servants should do according to this<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing:<br>
</p>

<p id="id01346">01:044:008 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?<br>
</p>

<p id="id01347" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:044:009 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die,
           and we also will be my lord's bondmen.</p>

<p id="id01348" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:044:010 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he
           with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be
           blameless.</p>

<p id="id01349">01:044:011 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and opened every man his sack.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01350">01:044:012 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01351">01:044:013 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returned to the city.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01352">01:044:014 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01353">01:044:015 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?<br>
</p>

<p id="id01357" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:044:019 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a

<p id="id01437" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:047:003 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation?
           And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both
           we, and also our fathers.</p>

<p id="id01438" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:047:004 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are
           we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks;
           for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore,
           we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.</p>

<p id="id01439" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:047:005 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy

           them, then make them rulers over my cattle.</p>

<p id="id01441" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:047:007 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before

<p id="id01443" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:047:009 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my
           pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have
           the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained
           unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the
           days of their pilgrimage.</p>

<p id="id01444">01:047:010 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.</p>

<p id="id01445" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:047:011 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a
           possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in

<p id="id01446" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:047:012 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his

<p id="id01447" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:047:013 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was
           very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of
           Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.</p>

<p id="id01448">01:047:014 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's<br>

</p>

<p id="id01449">01:047:015 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money<br>

           them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for
           the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them
           with bread for all their cattle for that year.</p>

<p id="id01452" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:047:018 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,
           and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that
           our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle;
           there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our

           and not die, that the land be not desolate.</p>

<p id="id01454" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:047:020 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the
           Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine
           prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.</p>

<p id="id01455" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:047:021 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end

<p id="id01456" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:047:022 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests
           had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their
           portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their
           lands.</p>

<p id="id01457" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:047:023 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you
           this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you,
           and ye shall sow the land.</p>

<p id="id01458" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:047:024 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give
           the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own,
           for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your
           households, and for food for your little ones.</p>

<p id="id01459" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:047:025 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in

<p id="id01460">01:047:026 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01461">01:047:027 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multiplied exceedingly.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01462" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:047:028 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the

<p id="id01463" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:047:029 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his
           son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in
           thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal
           kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:</p>

<p id="id01464" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:047:030 But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of
           Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will
           do as thou hast said.</p>

<p id="id01465" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:047:031 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel
           bowed himself upon the bed's head.</p>

<p id="id01466">01:048:001 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manasseh and Ephraim.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01467">01:048:002 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bed.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01468">01:048:003 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at<br>

</p>

<p id="id01469" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:048:004 And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and

           everlasting possession.</p>

<p id="id01470">01:048:005 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born<br>

<p id="id01472" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:048:007 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in

           Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.</p>

<p id="id01473">01:048:008 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?</p>

<p id="id01477">01:048:012 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to his blessing he blessed them.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01516">01:049:029 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the field of Ephron the Hittite,<br>

<p id="id01517" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:049:030 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before

           field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a
           buryingplace.</p>

<p id="id01518">01:049:031 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01519">01:049:032 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the children of Heth.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01520" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:049:033 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he
           gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost,
           and was gathered unto his people.</p>

<p id="id01521">01:050:001 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kissed him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01522">01:050:002 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01523">01:050:003 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mourned for him threescore and ten days.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01524">01:050:004 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,<br>
</p>

<p id="id01525" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:050:005 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which
           I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou
           bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my
           father, and I will come again.</p>

<p id="id01526" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:050:006 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he
           made thee swear.</p>

<p id="id01527">01:050:007 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the elders of the land of Egypt,<br>
</p>

<p id="id01528">01:050:008 And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01529" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:050:009 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it
           was a very great company.</p>

<p id="id01530" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:050:010 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond
           Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore
           lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.</p>

<p id="id01531" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:050:011 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the
           mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous
           mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called
           Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.</p>

<p id="id01532">01:050:012 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:</p>

<p id="id01533" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:050:013 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried
           him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham
           bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of
           Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.</p>

<p id="id01534">01:050:014 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his father.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01535">01:050:015 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01536" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:050:016 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did
           command before he died, saying,</p>

<p id="id01537" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:050:017 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the
           trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto
           thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the
           servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they
           spake unto him.</p>

<p id="id01538">01:050:018 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they said, Behold, we be thy servants.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01539">01:050:019 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God?<br>
</p>

<p id="id01540" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%">01:050:020 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it
           unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much
           people alive.</p>

<p id="id01541">01:050:021 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01542">01:050:022 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01543">01:050:023 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon Joseph's knees.<br>
</p>

<p id="id01544">01:050:024 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely<br>

</p>

<p id="id01545">01:050:025 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hence.<br>

<p id="id01550">Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p id="id01551">We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p id="id01552">Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p id="id01555" style="margin-top: 2em">Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the

<p id="id01560">We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p id="id01561">The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>
