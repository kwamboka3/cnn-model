    "# Sentiment Analysis - Unsupervised Lexical Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Textual data in spite of being highly unstructured, can be classified into two major types of documents. \n",
    "- __Factual documents__ which typically depict some form of statements or facts with no specific feelings or emotion attached to them. These are also known as objective documents. \n",
    "- __Subjective documents__ on the other hand have text which expresses feelings, mood, emotions and opinion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis is also popularly known as opinion analysis or opinion mining. The key idea is to use techniques from text analytics, NLP, machine learning and linguistics to extract important information or data points from unstructured text. This in turn can help us derive qualitative outputs like the overall sentiment being on a positive, neutral or negative scale and quantitative outputs like the sentiment polarity, subjectivity and objectivity proportions. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](sentiment_banner.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment polarity is typically a numeric score which is assigned to both the positive and negative aspects of a text document based on subjective parameters like specific words and phrases expressing feelings and emotion. Neutral sentiment typically has 0 polarity since it does not express any specific sentiment, positive sentiment will have polarity > 0 and negative < 0. Of course you can always change these thresholds based on the type of text you are dealing with and there are no hard constraints on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised sentiment analysis models make use of well curated knowledgebases, ontologies, lexicons and databases which have detailed information pertaining to subjective words, phrases including sentiment, mood, polarity, objectivity, subjectivity and so on. A lexicon model typically uses a lexicon, also known as a dictionary or vocabulary of words specifically aligned towards sentiment analysis. Usually these lexicons contain a list of words associated with positive and negative sentiment, polarity (magnitude of negative or positive score), parts of speech (POS) tags, subjectivity classifiers (strong, weak, neutral), mood, modality and so on.
